Link External Account - not really sure of a way to implement this without having a third DB file with some predefined accounts
Refresh Data - kinda goes hand in hand with link financial account

Export Data - this is not done yet but it will take me like 10 minutes to implement. I'm just going to filter the TransactinsDB file
              for the current user's transactions, remove the account ID from the row 
              and save them in a new file on the user's desktop and display a message saying
              it has been saved in CSV format and to open using a CSV viewer such as excel
            
Reports - at least we have something implemented for them so maybe it won't matter but they don't match the use cases because
          they currently don't make use of any transaction data
