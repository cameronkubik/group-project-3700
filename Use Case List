Create An Account
  - creating an account in CashStash
Logging In
  - logging in to CashStash (displays a transaction overview page or budget or cash flow based on profile setting) 
Logging Out
  - logging out to CashStash (will check to make sure everything is saved first)
Delete Account
  - get rid of all data related to your account in CashStash
Manage Profile
  - users can edit their profile information such as password, address, phone number, default login screen, etc.
Link External Account 
  - connect CashStash account to your bank account and other things to sync transactions
  
Create Transaction
  - manually enter transaction details
Schedule Transaction 
  - manually create a transaction that will reoccur at a defined frequency
Generate Budget Report
  - user defines expense categories and sets a percentage or fixed amount of their income towards those categories
  - a report is then generated breaking down their monthly income based on these settings
Check Credit Score
  - user can check their current credit score by querying an external service
Calculate Cash Flow
  - generates a report comparing income and expenses for a given time period
Compare Budget to Cash Flow (trying to think of a good name) 
  - this will basically compare your budget to your cash flow to see how well they match up (if you've spent too much or managed to save more) 

Export Data
  - creates an excel file containing all of the transactions in your account
Print Data
  - prints the current feature (budget, cash flow, etc.)
  
  That's 14 cases.. still need to think of one more.
